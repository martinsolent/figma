"Design for the web made easy
Figma was built for the future of web. That’s why you’ll see features you won’t find elsewhere.

A modern pen tool: Draw in any direction with Vector Networks. No more merging or needing to connect to the path's original point.
Instant arc designs: Design clocks, watch screens, or pie charts easily with the Arc tool.
Be expressive with OpenType: Tap into advanced font features to fully express your brand."
