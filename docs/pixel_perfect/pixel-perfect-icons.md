# Pixel Perfect 1 - Icons
 Creating icons is more associated with general design or illustration, but is important for a digital designer/UX to understand the core principles of how an icon is constructed and implemented within a UI layout and more importantly how it structure relates to A given design system.

Creating a family of icons is time-consuming, although Figma can create and work with Vector Images these are basic in comparison to what you would find in [Adobe illustrator](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374-Copy-assets-between-design-tools) and also there is a large amount of free to use icons available through Figma Community so it would be best to use these rather creating your own but it is important to learn how to make an icon. Here we will import an icon from [Material Design (Community)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1014241558898418245) which can be found in [Figma Community.](https://www.figma.com/community)



First of all we will create a 24x24px container for our icon. Not all icons have a container but this is part of the design system Google material design the container is good for helping to align and space irregular shaped icons with the actual icon sitting within this container.

1. Select the Frame Tools from the Toolbar Press F on your keyboard.

2. Drag out from the centre guide while holding `Alt` and `Shift` on your keyboard this will create a perfect square and create from the centre.

3. We will add a Stroke (border) 0.1pt Just as a guide which will be switched off at the end.

Inside this container we will create a circle using the ellipse tool.

1. the Toolbar Embedded in the shapes Press `o` on your keyboard 

2. Drag out from the centre while holding `Alt` and `Shift` on your keyboard this will create a perfect circle and create from the centre.

3. Set the Stroke to 2pt and turn off Fill colour.

4. Make sure the stroke is Centred

Select the Pen tool from the Toolbar or press `P` on the keyboard.

Using the guides from the example we are copying click two points to cut off the top of the circle - You do this by clicking on one point on the right..

...then moving across to the opposite side and clicking the second point - This will draw a line across the top of the circle.

Now click on the top Vector point of the circle and press delete
