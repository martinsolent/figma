# Adobe XD Basics

This walk-through uses Google Material Design guidelines do create proportionally sized and aligned design assets (components) on an 8pt grid with 16 & 24pt spacing of icons. It also covers naming protocols, the grouping of layers, creating and updating components, locally and on the cloud.
