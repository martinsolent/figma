# Design System Naming Conventions
 

‌
For example: our button component has the following name: 

`Button/Primary/Large/Default/True`

Once converted, the resulting variant will look like:

Component name: Button

* Variant: Primary
* Property 2: Large
* Property 3: Default
* Property 4: True

You’ll be able to change the name and order of any properties once you convert them to variants. Reorder properties in the Variants section of the right sidebar. This will also change the order of the values in each variant’s name.

Components are UI elements that you can reuse across your designs.

* The main component defines the properties of the element.
* The instance is a copy of the component you can reuse in your designs.
