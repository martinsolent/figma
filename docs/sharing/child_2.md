# Web & App Mock-ups

Designing a mock-up of your UI is a great way to visualise and promote your UX/UI project. Figma offers tools that make it easy to create a polished representation of your design, which you can use in various ways:

**Project File Cover:** Use the mock-up as a thumbnail on your Figma project file. This provides a professional look and gives viewers an immediate idea of what your project is about.

**Export for External Use:** Export your Figma mock-up to showcase it elsewhere, whether in presentations, portfolios, or social media.
