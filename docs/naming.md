Name Components
If you want to add another layer of Organization, you can name your components in a particular way. We recommend you use the slash separated convention e.g. Component/State.

Let's say you have named the components in a frame like this:

Login/Active
Login/Hover
Login/Inactive
Create/Active
Create/Hover
Create/Inactive
