Create a title bar -with a menu icon, a title and an icon in this case a search/magnifying glass

Now we will create a label item this will consist of the frame with an ellipse shape containing an avatar and the name label.

Create a list item save it as a component then create a variance with the second variant this will be the hover state so change the background colour

You will need to create a component to be the drawer navigation which will come in from the right of the screen this has a header with an avatar and a list of items

You can now copy out an instance of your list item and duplicate it before creating it as a component

![](../images/draw_1/draw_15.png)

You will now have the following components in the asset panel

![](../images/draw_1/draw_16.png)

Now publish (this vwill only work if in a Teams Plan)

Once published we can create a new project/ Figma File and import if you do not have a Teams Plan you can use the in your Figma file.

Create a new Frame 360 x 800
Call it **Home** 

![](../images/draw_inter/2.png)

The Assets (Components) have already been created and/or imported as a shared library into out File (Project)

Drag out the **titlebar** on to the **Home** Frame and position

![](../images/draw_inter/3.png)

Drag out **List**  component and position

![](../images/draw_inter/drag_list.png)

Resize by dragging down the **List** component to make it **1659** high. It this case this is the "height" of the component that has been created to allow for a scroll affect

![](../images/draw_inter/5.png)

![](../images/draw_inter/1659.png)

Now select the **titlebar** in the **Properties** panel switch **Design** to **Prototype**

Within the **Scroll Behaviour** section change to **Fixed (stay in place)**
