# Interaction


Interaction design (IxD) is a discipline within the field of user experience (UX) design that focuses on creating meaningful and engaging interactions between users and digital products or services. It encompasses the design of the user interface and the overall user experience. Interaction designers work to make digital products and interfaces intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.
