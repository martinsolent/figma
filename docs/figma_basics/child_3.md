# Pixel Perfect 1 - Icons
 Creating icons is more associated with general design or illustration, but is important for a digital designer/UX to understand the core principles of how an icon is constructed and implemented within a UI layout and more importantly how it structure relates to A given design system.

Creating a family of icons is time-consuming, although Figma can create and work with Vector Images these are basic in comparison to what you would find in [Adobe illustrator](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374-Copy-assets-between-design-tools) and also there is a large amount of free to use icons available through Figma Community so it would be best to use these rather creating your own but it is important to learn how to make an icon. Here we will import an icon from [Material Design (Community)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1014241558898418245) which can be found in [Figma Community.](https://www.figma.com/community)



First of all we will create a 24x24px container for our icon.

Select the Frame Tools from the Toolbar Press F on your keyboard.

Drag out from the centre guide while holding `Alt` and `Shift` on your keyboard this will create a perfect circle and create from the centre.

We will add a Stroke (border) 0.1pt Just as a guide which will be switched off at the end.
