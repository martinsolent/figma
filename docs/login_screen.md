We are going to make a login screen based on [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/components/text-fields#anatomy) in Figma although the principles can be applied to other programmes such as Adobe XD

![](log_images/fig_log_1.png)

Create a new Figma Design Document give it a name a create 2 page:
 
1. Components
1. Layout

![](log_images/fig_create_1.png)

One the Components Page drag out a Section for design notes

![](log_images/fig_section.png)

Still on the Components Page drag out a 466 W x 1284 H Frame and name it "Components"

![](log_images/fig_frrame_1.png)

Set-up up an 4 pt Grid on this Frame

![](log_images/fig_grid.png)

Create a component sheet of all your colours and components and also select your typography styles and download the icons you wish to use in this project they were selected from the [Material Design icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) (sometimes you might want to create your own using the icon design principle they use in this design system)


![](log_images/fig_log_13.png)

You can use a design system/ platform to select your colour scheme here we have use the Google Material Design Colour Tool

![](log_images/login_d_5.png)

Create 3 colour swatches and add their HEX values

![](log_images/fig_log_2.png)

We will now create a Title Bar at the top of the screen

![](log_images/fig_log_3.png)

First create a status bar is 24 H x 360 W

![](log_images/login_d_16.png)

Then Title box underneath 56 H x 360 W and the font is Roboto medium 24pt

![](log_images/login_d_15.png)

Then we move onto the username/email field - this is based upon guidance in Google material design


The username/email field is 328 x 56 with a 1 pt and Stroke colour 645E5E

![](log_images/fig_log_4.png)


As with the username/email field the password component was added this has the option to total between the text being visible or just a set of dots.

The password field is 328 x 56 pixels

Change the Password Field into a Component (by Right-Mouse_clicking) then turn it into a Variant

![](log_images/Variant.png)

Create 2 functions in this Variant for show/hide Password

![](log_images/fig_log_5.png)

Find icons from Figma Community - and select 

![](log_images/plug.png)

Find the following icons:

![](log_images/fig_log_6.png)

Then create a 328 w x 56 h login button use as a Variant for rollover (Hovering) or While Pressing 

![](log_images/fig_log_11.png)

Then there is a section for remembering me, there is functionality to click to check the box and also there is a link to a forgot password word screen.

Create this as a 2 function Variant

![](log_images/fig_log_7.png)

On the Layout page create a 360 H x 800 W Frame.

![](log_images/screen.png)

Click on Assets in the left panel and drag drop your Components to the Frame with 4 or 8 pt grid and leave 16 margin
